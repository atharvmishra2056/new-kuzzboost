ALTER TABLE public.profiles
ADD COLUMN referral_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN referral_code TEXT UNIQUE,
ADD COLUMN credits NUMERIC DEFAULT 0;

-- New referrals table
CREATE TABLE public.referrals (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  referrer_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  referred_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(referrer_id, referred_id)
);

-- Credit increment function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.increment_credits(p_user_id UUID, p_amount NUMERIC)
RETURNS void LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

## üéØ Business Flow

### For Referrers

2. User accesses referrals page and gets unique invite link
3. User shares invite link with friends

5. User can use credits (min 100) for future purchases at 5 credits = ‚Çπ4 rate

### For Referred Users

2. Makes purchases normally
3. When admin marks their orders as completed, referrer gets credits
